      <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
          I'm a passionate <strong>MERN Stack Developer</strong> who loves building full-stack web
          applications and solving real-world problems. My journey into web development started 
          with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, which turned into a career 
          building modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in <strong>React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB</strong>. I enjoy the process 
          of turning a complex problem into a simple, elegant solution through clean and efficient 
          code. I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with the latest 
          industry trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new UI/UX designs or working on 
          personal projects to sharpen my logic and architectural skills.
